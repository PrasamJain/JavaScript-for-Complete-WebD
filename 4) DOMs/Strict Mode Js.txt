#STRICT MODE IN JS

The strict mode was introduced in ECMAScript 5. It is a way to add a strict checking in JavaScript that would make fewer mistakes.
Strict mode introduces several restrictions to the JavaScript code like eliminates some silent errors by throwing errors.

JavaScript allows strict mode code and non-strict mode code to coexist. So you can add your new JavaScript code in strict mode in old JavaScript files.

You can introduce a strict mode in your JavaScript code by writing this simple statement -
	'use strict'; OR "use strict";

You can apply strict mode to an entire script or to individual function -
	● Write this at the top of the whole script to apply strict mode globally.
	● Or write it inside functions to apply it to a particular function only.

Eg., you have a function as -

		function abc(a, a) {
		console.log(a + a);
		}
		abc(10, 20);

The above code will print 40 on the console, whereas if you use strict mode as -

		function abc(a, a) {
		'use strict';
		console.log(a + a);
		}
		abc(10, 20);

This code will produce an error - 'SyntaxError: duplicate formal argument a'.
